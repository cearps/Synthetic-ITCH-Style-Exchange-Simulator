# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This project uses Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) to capture important choices and the reasoning behind them.

## When to write an ADR

Create an ADR when you make a decision that is:
- hard to reverse,
- cross-cutting (affects multiple components),
- likely to be debated later,
- or important for downstream consumers (wire format, determinism model, replay semantics).

## How to write an ADR

1. Copy [the template](0000-adr-template.md)
2. Create a new file named `NNNN-short-title.md` (4-digit, zero-padded)
3. Fill it out and link it in the index below

## ADR index
