# AI worklog format

This document defines where and how AI agents should record work performed on the repository.

## Where to write

Record work in:

- `worklog/WORKLOG.md`

If a change is “major” (large behavior change, new component, public interface change, architectural decision), update the worklog as part of completing the change.

## Format

Each entry should be appended to the end of the file and contain:

1. A short header that includes date, author, and scope
2. An AI-generated section (what changed, why, how validated, tradeoffs)
3. A manual additions section (left for humans to edit)

Use the template in `worklog/WORKLOG.md`.
